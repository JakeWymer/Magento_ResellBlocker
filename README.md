# Magento_ResellBlocker
A magento module that allows you to set a spending cap per customer within a certain timeframe as a measure to prevent the bulk ordering and reselling of your products.

INSTALLATION:

Copy the 'Jakey' folder to /magento/app/code/local/
Then copy 'Jakey_ResellBlocker.xml' to /magento/app/etc/modules/

Flush the magento cache and you should have a resell blocker tab in the admin system config.
